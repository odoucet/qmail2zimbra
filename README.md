# qmail2zimbra
Qmail config converter to Zimbra commands


What it does
------------

* Convert email accounts
* Handle user quota
* Handle mailing lists
* Handle autoresponder
* Handle redirections to external addresses
* Handle redirections to same domain
* Handle catchall to an email

Limitations
-----

* Account names with accents will be f**ed up. Sorry, won't work. The actual behaviour is to import it with bad
accents, and you should edit them afterwards with Zimbra web interface. Any fix welcome :)
